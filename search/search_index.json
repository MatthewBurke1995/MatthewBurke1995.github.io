The exact solution is easy with a bit of probability theory. The approximation requires a bit of intuition, and a much longer explanation. The first iteration I saw of this question required solving the problem without a calculator. The exact solution is easy with a bit of probability theory. The approximation requires a bit of intuition, and a much longer explanation. The general solution is . The chance of each failure is , the chance of n consecutive failures is , take the complementary even by subtracting it from 1. In the above case and . With a calculator the answer to two decimal places is 0.63. When I first heard the question, my first method of approximating the answer was to use and , with the expectation that having a small p value and large n value would all be approximations of the same expression. Let's introduce an approximation: for very small values of p. And the definition of : Given , let and . . Using the approximation for small x: . . The expression is particularly nice when we assume , but even without the assumption, we could still receive an answer in terms of e: This shows that the cumulative probability of passing one interview is based on the value of only, with the caveat that the higher the value of the closer the solution is to the approximation that uses .","title":"Geometry"},{"location":"meritocracy/","text":"Meritocracy I recently read Michael Sandel's book \"The Tyranny of Merit\" on the recommendation of The Guardian's best books of 2020. The book is good and although it is mostly focused on the American implementation of a meritocratic system it was enough to reveal the inconsistent values that I see in Australia and to an even worse extent Korea. Truthfully, I am a benefactor of the meritocratic systems of the countries that I have lived in. I've received an expensive education. I work in an economy where my talents and intellectual interests are highly valued, which gives me the double benefit of status and wealth. But I could have just as easily been born in a situation where I wasn't able to receive an expensive education or live in an economy where my labour is valued. And neither case would be the result of my choices. While reading I felt the most pity for the current generation of Koreans that are in or about to enter their 20s. South Korea, as Sandel noted, might be the most meritocratic country in the world. The university admission exams are conducted yearly, many of those that can't reach their favoured universities will repeat the exam 2 or 3 times. As such, exam first-timers are often competing against people that have dedicated 3 years to the exam which makes their prospects even worse. Even amongst those that graduate from the top universities, a large number will choose to sit the biannual public administration exam. Some of these exams have an admission rate less than Harvard which is why many people typically devote years to the task despite no guarantee of success. On the other end of the spectrum there are the 3D jobs (Dirty, Dangerous and Difficult). The unofficial fourth 'D' is 'demeaning'. 3D jobs aren't inherently low paid or 'demeaning'. But in a conformist society where the be-all and end-all is academic rigour then those that refuse to play are considered losers. Sandel spends a lot of time comparing the education system to a merit sorting machine. Sorting and ranking is ultimately a mathematical discipline. Take the feature vector [x1,x2...xn] and the weighting vector [w1,w2,...wn], calculate the inner product and now you have your single number for ranking. In this analogy the features would be a student's abilities and the weight vector would be how each ability is valued in society. If there are a variety of weighting vectors then each student has several options of optimising their own feature vector. But if the weight vector is always [1,0,...0] then students can only compete on the x1 feature. Even if there are other weight vectors around they have to be made known when students start optimising for their futures. What ends up being measured is a students' ability to optimise i.e. study for a test. There is a correlation between test marks and good characteristics such as intelligence and hard work. But there is an even higher correlation for parents income, which makes test scores as a measure of ability entirely unfair.","title":"Meritocracy"},{"location":"meritocracy/#meritocracy","text":"I recently read Michael Sandel's book \"The Tyranny of Merit\" on the recommendation of The Guardian's best books of 2020.
