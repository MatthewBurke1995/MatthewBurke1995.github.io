# The Software Architect Elevator: Redefining the Architect's Role in the Digital Enterprise By Gregor Hohpe

I recenently read Hohpe's book on the role, objetives and skills of a software architect. This book is dense with information but I was able to read it at a breezy pace, Hohpe walks the walk when he writes than an architect has to be succinct and insightful. 

The book is divided into fice equal length sections i.e. 'Architects', 'Architecture', 'Communication', 'Organizations' and 'Transformation'.

## Architects

The title of the book comes from the first chapter, architects are able to ride the elevator between the top floor executive suite and the engine room of IT, bypassing the levels of middle management. To be effective they must be skillful, impactful and have leadership qualities. If they do everything right and reach the penthouse they must not stay there, in case their skills become blunt or they lose context of the engine room.


## Architecture

Architecture is about keeping your options open. In the financial world you can buy put or call options to sell or buy a stock at a certain price by a future date, in which case you delay the choice of buying or selling. This is valuable in the same way that delaying software choices before you have a full picture is valuable. 

In software it's important to cut the dead weight, if you never retire a software system you will end up living among zombies. The lifecycle of creating, upgrading and removing systems is much easier if they are software defined.

## Communication

Communicating is a lot like mountain climbing. Imagine you have to take someone up to the top of a hill so they can see what you have seen. If you take the steepest path then you, the guide, will reach your destination quickly but many will not be able to follow. But if you take the gradual path then everyone will be able to reach the peak of enlightenment. To help in this effort, it's good to build a shared vocabulary (similar to ubiquitous language in DDD), and keep to the same level of abstraction within a document e.g. don't talk about hardware, software and the network within the same paragraph.

## Organizations

Stephen Bungay talks about the three gaps of control and the 'control illusion'. An organization creates plans based on what they perceive reality to be, those plans turn into actions which in turn should affect reality. Each side of this triangle (reality, plans, actions) represents a gap that the organization seeks to fill. If the plans are not being built on reality there is a knowledge gap, if plans do not lead to actions then there is an alignment gap (solution: micromanaging) and if actions don't work there is an effects gap. The 'control illusion' is the idea that these gaps can be filled in a top down way. The only real control is autonomy which requires trusting the team, strategy, enablement and continuous feedback.

Copying the processes of other hip technology companies is cargoculting. 


## Transformation

Similar to the twelve steps of Alchoholics Anonymous the first step of transformation is to admit that there is a problem, sometimes the most effective thing an architect can do is to show where the pain is.
