# The Golden Rule of Time

Why do some people in safe jobs work long nights with no chance of reward? Why do we espouse certain values that we don't follow?

Recently, I read "The Time Paradox" by Zimbardo and Boyd. I enjoy reading pop psychology as long as they have a bit more depth and legitimacy than power posing, fortunately Boyd and Zimbardo's writing about the psychology of time is profound. Although it is not the focus of the book, the section I enjoyed the most was their discussion of "The Golden Rule of Time".

The golden rule of time goes something like this: "Spend your time the way you wish others would spend their time." A reference point might be more useful, imagine your son or daughter has to make the choice of working until late  at a job with no prospect of promotion in the immediate future or they can go home on time? Almost everyone would wish that their child enjoyed their freetime yet that is not the choice that many people make in reality. The golden rule of time is a way of framing the strangeness of these choices and clarifying the decision making process.

As to the questions in the first paragraph, I have no good answer. Maybe it is due to Freud's hypothesized fear of death, which exists on such a subconscious level that we don't consider it when speaking of others. Maybe we are at our most rational when we consider other people. Hopefully with 'The Golden Rule of Time' in your toolbelt you can use that rationality, usually reserved for others, on yourself.
