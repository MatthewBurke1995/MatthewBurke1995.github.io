# Moral Philosophy


I spend a lot of time reading discussions on Reddit or Hacker News. On the forum "AmITheAsshole" redditors pose their moral quandaries to thousands of people. Most of the time the answer there is a clear villain and we can all agree that the author is morally right or morally wrong. Arguably the authors of these posts know that they will be morally vindicated and just require some encouragement for their actions. 

But in many occasions the answer isn't obvious. On the forum "ExperiencedDevs" many of the questions are more difficult to parse. Your team is not mature in its processes, it can be a difficult and thankless task to bring them up to speed. What should you do?

The details are important in this situation, but once you have the details how do you make a moral judgement? Moral Philosophy is the branch of Philosophy that deals with these questions. I'll outline three frameworks to help with making moral decisions.

## 1. Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism is the most mathematical of the frameworks. Each action should maximise the total happiness. Even if we can write this as a mathematical equation:

$$
\text{maximize} \int_{t=0}^{\infty} \int_{person=0}^N Happiness(person,t)
$$

Utilitarianism can be very useful when arguing for the common good outside of a rights based framework but when examined closely it has some severe issues. It's impossible to compare the happiness functions of each individual, moreso if an individual feels happiness and sadness particularly acutely then there needs should be considered a priority compared to others. Another issue is that we would have to evaluate the marginal happiness of each action in perpetuity, which includes future generations dealing with issues that could be totally unfamiliar to us. 

## 2. Categorical Imperative a.k.a. 'Universal Rules'

The categorical imperative is the closest moral framework to the golden rule. Succinctly people should act in a way that you would want everyone to act. Choosing to vote in an upcoming election can be a lot of effort and it's unlikely that a single vote could sway an election, So is it immoral not to vote? If we used the categorical imperative and imagined that everyone chose not to vote then we would have serious issues with our democracies. Therefore moral citizens should vote. 

Similarly, is it alright to lie? White lies serve an important function if you believe that maintaing relationships are important even at the point of having to bend the truth. But what if everyone lied all the time? Such a society would be much worse than a truthful society. Therefore lying must be immoral. If we try and add any nuance then it becomes even more difficult, "lying is not acceptable unless it is for the sake of maintaining a relationship," there are many examples when this would be a good rule and some where it would not. Trying to account for all of the exceptions and conditions makes defining even a single rule difficult. 


## 3. Virtue Ethics

Out of the three frameworks so far, 'virtue ethics' is the furthest framework from public thought which makes it the most useful in providing a fresh perspective. Virtue ethics is often about intent, in every action we make we should use the proper proportion of virtues required of the task. If we see an injustice then we should react with the appropriate measure of compassion, righteousness and also patience. Each action will require different amounts of good virtues.

So what should we do with a difficult working environment that we have the power to improve? According to utilitarianism we should weigh up the chance of succeeding the utility of that success. If we can think of a categorical imperative that applies to this situation we should follow that. With virtual ethics we should exercise an appropriate amount of patience, mental fortitude and give it a good go.
