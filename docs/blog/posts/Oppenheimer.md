# Korean government releases Oppenheimer film on Independence Day

This weekend, moviegoers around the world are taking part in the double feature of 'Barbenheimer'  (a portmanteau of 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer'). Korean citizens won't be able to partake as the 'Oppenheimer' release date has been pushed back to align with the South Korean independence day holiday.

The connection between 'Oppenheimer' and Korea's independence is obvious enough. The atom bombs were dropped on Japanese territory, and a week later the Japanese surrendered the war and surrendered the colonies of Korea and Taiwan.

But when South Korea celebrates their independence should they also celebrate the atom bomb? When the atom bombs were dropped many of the victims were Koreans who had been conscripted to work towards the Japanese war effort. Besides, 'Oppenheimer' is the story of a morally ambivelant American victory which is thematically far removed from the celebratory occasion of a country's independence.

The Korean film industry is a protected industry which includes embargoes on foreign films and their release dates. The historically protectionist policies have allowed the South Korean film industry to flourish, including the recent high point of 'Parasite' winning the Oscar for best film. On the downside there are some anomalies that are hard to explain. The [Korean Film Council (KOFIC)](https://www.kofic.or.kr/) make some strange decisions. For example, IMAX theatres have a quota for foreign film time slots. 'Dune' had it's IMAX schedule cut short in 2021 to be replaced by a Korean romantic comedy so that Spiderman could have enough time to later on.

The South Korean government's KOFIC organization have given 'Oppenheimer' an independence day release date and all of it's associated baggage. I don't think government's that support free market economies should put their stamp on foreign artworks. It feels as if a government bureaucrat changed the title to "Oppenheimer: Korean Independence Edition", which is far removed from what the director intended.
