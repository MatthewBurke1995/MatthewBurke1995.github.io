# Matt's thoughts on things

## Who

Hi, I'm Matt. I'm originally from Australia but I'm currently working in Korea for a fintech startup. I graduated with a BSc Physics from Macquarie University in 2018 and since then have had the good fortune to work at the RBA and IBM. I enjoy reading and writing about applied maths, computer science and Korean culture.
