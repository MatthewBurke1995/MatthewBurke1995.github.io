# Matt's thoughts on things

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Thanks for checking out this page.

I'm Matt and I've worked as a Software Engineer and Data Scientist. I graduated with a BSc in Physics, but discovered I was more interested in software during my studies. In my spare time I like to read non-fiction, go hiking, be disappointed by Tottenham and watch every movie that has ever recieved an oscar nomination.

I have used R, Python, Javascript/Node, Java and C# in professional contexts while working at the Reserve Bank of Australia (Data Analyst in a central bank), IBM (Software Engineer in search and web development domains) and Wavebridge (Quantative Researcher in a hedge fund). In terms of human languages I am fluent in Korean.
