# Meritocracy

I read Michael Sandel's book "The Tyranny of Merit" based on the recommendation of The Guardian's best books of 2020. The book is good and although it's focused on the American implementation of a meritocratic system it's enough to reveal the inconsistent values that I see in Australia and to an even worse extent in South Korea.

I am a benefactor of the meritocratic systems of the countries that I have lived in. I've received an expensive education. I work in an economy where my talents and intellectual interests are highly valued, which gives me the double benefit of status and wealth. But I could have been born in a situation where I wasn't able to receive an expensive education or live in an economy where my labour is valued. And neither case would be the result of my choices.

While reading I felt the most pity for the current generation of Koreans that are in or about to enter their 20s. South Korea, as Sandel noted, might be the most meritocratic country in the world. The university admission exams are conducted yearly, those that can't reach their favoured universities will repeat the exam 2 or 3 times. As such, exam first-timers are often competing against people that have dedicated 3 years to the exam which makes their prospects even worse.

Even amongst those that graduate from the top universities, a large number will choose to sit the biannual public administration exam. Some of these exams have an admission rate less than Harvard which is why some people typically devote years to the task despite no guarantee of success.

On the other end of the spectrum there are the 3D jobs (Dirty, Dangerous and Difficult). The unofficial fourth 'D' is 'demeaning'. 3D jobs aren't inherently low paid or 'demeaning'. But in a conformist society where the be-all and end-all is academic rigour then those that refuse to play are considered losers.

Sandel spends a lot of time comparing the education system to a merit sorting machine. Sorting and ranking is ultimately a mathematical discipline. Take the feature vector [x1,x2...xn] and the weighting vector [w1,w2,...wn], calculate the inner product and now you have your single number for ranking. In this analogy the features would be a student's abilities and the weight vector would be how each ability is valued in society. If there are a variety of weighting vectors then each student has options of optimising their own feature vector. But if the weight vector is always [1,0,...0] then students must compete on the x1 feature.

Even if there are other weight vectors around they have to be made known when students start optimising for their futures. What ends up being measured is a students' ability to optimise i.e. study for a test. There is a correlation between test marks and good characteristics such as intelligence and hard work. But there is an even higher correlation for parents income, which makes test scores as a measure of ability entirely unfair.
