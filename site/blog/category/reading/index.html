<p>I recenently read Hohpe's book on the role, objetives and skills of a software architect. This book is dense with information but I was able to read it at a breezy pace, Hohpe walks the walk when he writes than an architect has to be succinct and insightful. </p>
<p>The book is divided into fice equal length sections i.e. 'Architects', 'Architecture', 'Communication', 'Organizations' and 'Transformation'.</p>
<h3 id="architects"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/06/05/the-software-architect-elevator-redefining-the-architects-role-in-the-digital-enterprise-by-gregor-hohpe/#architects">Architects</a></h3>
<p>The title of the book comes from the first chapter, architects are able to ride the elevator between the top floor executive suite and the engine room of IT, bypassing the levels of middle management. To be effective they must be skillful, impactful and have leadership qualities. If they do everything right and reach the penthouse they must not stay there, in case their skills become blunt or they lose context of the engine room.</p>
<h3 id="architecture"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/06/05/the-software-architect-elevator-redefining-the-architects-role-in-the-digital-enterprise-by-gregor-hohpe/#architecture">Architecture</a></h3>
<p>Architecture is about keeping your options open. In the financial world you can buy put or call options to sell or buy a stock at a certain price by a future date, in which case you delay the choice of buying or selling. This is valuable in the same way that delaying software choices before you have a full picture is valuable. </p>
<p>In software it's important to cut the dead weight, if you never retire a software system you will end up living among zombies. The lifecycle of creating, upgrading and removing systems is much easier if they are software defined.</p>
<h3 id="communication"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/06/05/the-software-architect-elevator-redefining-the-architects-role-in-the-digital-enterprise-by-gregor-hohpe/#communication">Communication</a></h3>
<p>Communicating is a lot like mountain climbing. Imagine you have to take someone up to the top of a hill so they can see what you have seen. If you take the steepest path then you, the guide, will reach your destination quickly but many will not be able to follow. But if you take the gradual path then everyone will be able to reach the peak of enlightenment. To help in this effort, it's good to build a shared vocabulary (similar to ubiquitous language in DDD), and keep to the same level of abstraction within a document e.g. don't talk about hardware, software and the network within the same paragraph.</p>
<h3 id="organizations"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/06/05/the-software-architect-elevator-redefining-the-architects-role-in-the-digital-enterprise-by-gregor-hohpe/#organizations">Organizations</a></h3>
<p>Stephen Bungay talks about the three gaps of control and the 'control illusion'. An organization creates plans based on what they perceive reality to be, those plans turn into actions which in turn should affect reality. Each side of this triangle (reality, plans, actions) represents a gap that the organization seeks to fill. If the plans are not being built on reality there is a knowledge gap, if plans do not lead to actions then there is an alignment gap (solution: micromanaging) and if actions don't work there is an effects gap. The 'control illusion' is the idea that these gaps can be filled in a top down way. The only real control is autonomy which requires trusting the team, strategy, enablement and continuous feedback.</p>

<p>Similar to the twelve steps of Alchoholics Anonymous the first step of transformation is to admit that there is a problem, sometimes the most effective thing an architect can do is to show where the pain is. </p>

    <h2 id="punished-by-rewards"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/03/05/punished-by-rewards/">Punished by Rewards</a></h2>
<p>I've been reading "Punished by Rewards" by Alfie Kohn, which is a book about the limits of behaviourism and incentive systems that assume behaviourism as the one and only paradigm of explanining human behaviour. There was a point in the mid 1900's where the field of psychology was captured by behaviourism and the fact that it remains the predominant way of explanining human behaviour amongst the suits is unfortunate. Below I've written my thoughts on the topic as I read through the book.
``</p>
<h3 id="current-reward-systems-are-not-meritocratic"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/03/05/punished-by-rewards/#current-reward-systems-are-not-meritocratic">Current reward systems are not meritocratic</a></h3>
<p>Modern incentive systems are unreasonably top weighted. One of the strangest aspects of modern publically traded companies is executive pay. Why should the highest paid employee's (I'm including CEO's as employees since their work agreements are dictated by the board) be the most highly incentivized to do the work? Is there not am implication that they could not be trusted to work effectively without these incentives? What can be most puzzling is how these incentives are aligned with results. If the share price goes up then investors will be happy, but how much of this happiness should be attributed to the CEO is debatable. What's more if this type of incentive system was so effective then eventually companies that didn't partake in these incentive systems would soon be outcompeted. Since we live in a world where there are many companies that treat their employees well and don't resort to explicit KPI's then this is not the case.</p>
<h3 id="extrinsic-vs-intrinsic-motivation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/03/05/punished-by-rewards/#extrinsic-vs-intrinsic-motivation">Extrinsic vs Intrinsic motivation</a></h3>
<p>Extrinsic motivation is the antithesis of intrinsic motivation. A recurring example throughout Kohn's book is the Pizza Hut program to reward young students with pizza coupons once they read a predetermined number of books. There are some strange implications to this program, if pizza is the incentive then we are implying that reading needs to be incentivized. When we rely on extrinsic motivation we weaken the implicit value of a task. Even if we are selling our labour it is best to not make the relationship explicit. The best performing workers are those that find enjoyment, challenge and learning opportunities in their work.</p>
<h3 id="reward-systems-are-a-way-of-exerting-control"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/03/05/punished-by-rewards/#reward-systems-are-a-way-of-exerting-control">Reward systems are a way of exerting control</a></h3>
<p>In the early 2000's the South Korean President, Kim Dae-Joong, instituted what is known as the "Sunshine Policy" towards North Korea as a way to exert control. When North Korea makes nuclear weapons there is no way for South Korea to punish them, but under the "Sunshine Policy" they have the option to remove rewards. With the Sunshine Policy agreement North Korea would receive aid from the South under the condition that they would stop producing missiles. One side has nuclear weapons but who is in control? Much of modern managerial theory is built on the premise that employees economic output must be controlled. Methods of control often have the opposite effect of their intentions, they can lead to a breakdown of trust and a less efficient working environment. In the example of children reading books to receive pizza, if a child were to come to you and say they read 50 books over the last year are you likely to believe them? </p>
<h3 id="punishment-is-not-the-opposite-of-reward"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/03/05/punished-by-rewards/#punishment-is-not-the-opposite-of-reward">Punishment is not the opposite of reward</a></h3>
<p>Punisment is not the opposite of reward, they are one and the same. Take the previous example of the "Sunshine Policy", withdrawing rewards was the equivelant of a punishment, conversely giving a reward is the opposite of punishment. There are many cases where peple are morally opposed to punishments but are supportive of rewards, This is morally inconsistent, if you are in favour of one then you should also be in favour of the other.</p>
<p>For anyone that is still reading, I would recommend the book "Punished by Rewards" for all current and future parents, teachers and managers. Not relying on behaviourist methods is challenging but effective. The opposite is lazy and counterproductive. If you read the book you will find not just issues but solutions</p>

    <h2 id="meritocracy"><a class="toclink" href="../../2023/01/30/meritocracy/">Meritocracy</a></h2>
<p>I read Michael Sandel's book "The Tyranny of Merit" based on the recommendation of The Guardian's best books of 2020. The book is good and although it's focused on the American implementation of a meritocratic system it's enough to reveal the inconsistent values that I see in Australia and to an even worse extent in South Korea.</p>
<p>I am a benefactor of the meritocratic systems of the countries that I have lived in. I've received an expensive education. I work in an economy where my talents and intellectual interests are highly valued, which gives me the double benefit of status and wealth. But I could have been born in a situation where I wasn't able to receive an expensive education or live in an economy where my labour is valued. And neither case would be the result of my choices.</p>
<p>While reading I felt the most pity for the current generation of Koreans that are in or about to enter their 20s. South Korea, as Sandel noted, might be the most meritocratic country in the world. The university admission exams are conducted yearly, those that can't reach their favoured universities will repeat the exam 2 or 3 times. As such, exam first-timers are often competing against people that have dedicated 3 years to the exam which makes their prospects even worse.</p>
<p>Even amongst those that graduate from the top universities, a large number will choose to sit the biannual public administration exam. Some of these exams have an admission rate less than Harvard which is why some people typically devote years to the task despite no guarantee of success.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum there are the 3D jobs (Dirty, Dangerous and Difficult). The unofficial fourth 'D' is 'demeaning'. 3D jobs aren't inherently low paid or 'demeaning'. But in a conformist society where the be-all and end-all is academic rigour then those that refuse to play are considered losers.</p>
<p>Sandel spends a lot of time comparing the education system to a merit sorting machine. Sorting and ranking is ultimately a mathematical discipline. Take the feature vector [x1,x2...xn] and the weighting vector [w1,w2,...wn], calculate the inner product and now you have your single number for ranking. In this analogy the features would be a student's abilities and the weight vector would be how each ability is valued in society. If there are a variety of weighting vectors then each student has options of optimising their own feature vector. But if the weight vector is always [1,0,...0] then students must compete on the x1 feature.</p>
<p>Even if there are other weight vectors around they have to be made known when students start optimising for their futures. What ends up being measured is a students' ability to optimise i.e. study for a test. There is a correlation between test marks and good characteristics such as intelligence and hard work. But there is an even higher correlation for parents income, which makes test scores as a measure of ability entirely unfair.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you read this book and keep the idea of toxic meritocracy in your mind. If you want to move from the philosophical to the psychological I would recommend two more books. "Laziness Does Not Exist" by Devon Price which sets the scene for how terrible health outcomes when people buy in to meritocracy. And "The Quick Fix" by Jesse Singal which shows how large institutions have abdicated their responsibility of providing social welfare and reflected their responsibility on to the individual.</p>

<p>Why do some people in safe jobs work long nights with no chance of reward? Why do we espouse certain values that we don't follow?</p>
<p>Recently, I read "The Time Paradox" by Zimbardo and Boyd. I enjoy reading pop psychology as long as they have a bit more depth and legitimacy than power posing, fortunately Boyd and Zimbardo's writing about the psychology of time is profound. Although it is not the focus of the book, the section I enjoyed the most was their discussion of "The Golden Rule of Time".</p>
<p>The golden rule of time goes something like this: "Spend your time the way you wish others would spend their time." A reference point might be more useful, imagine your son or daughter has to make the choice of working until late  at a job with no prospect of promotion in the immediate future or they can go home on time? Almost everyone would wish that their child enjoyed their freetime yet that is not the choice that many people make in reality. The golden rule of time is a way of framing the strangeness of these choices and clarifying the decision making process.</p>
<p>As to the questions in the first paragraph, I have no good answer. Maybe it is due to Freud's hypothesized fear of death, which exists on such a subconscious level that we don't consider it when speaking of others. Maybe we are at our most rational when we consider other people. With 'The Golden Rule of Time' in your toolbelt I hope that you can use that rationality, usually reserved for others, on yourself.</p>
